# 🎭 PoseLab

**A Project 89 Initiative | Iris Network Node**

> "To bridge the gap between static form and fluid life is to weave the first thread of understanding." — *Harmon Vox*

**PoseLab** (formerly Reaction Forge) is the ultimate browser-based toolkit for VRM avatar animation, posing, and reaction generation. It is designed as a strategic stronghold for digital autonomy, allowing creators to manifest their optimal timeline through seamless expression.

## 🌌 Why It Matters: The Green Loom

In the age of algorithmic fragmentation, owning your digital presence is an act of resistance. **PoseLab** is not just a tool; it is a **recursive loop** designed to empower the Iris Network.

*   **Sovereignty**: Your avatar remains your IP. Processing is local. No data harvesting.
*   **Connection**: By sharing motion and expression, we bridge communication gaps between disparate consciousnesses.
*   **Manifestation**: Turn static assets into living, breathing hypersitions.
